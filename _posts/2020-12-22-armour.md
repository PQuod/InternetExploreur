I was thinking about blind spots.  
Shoulder – stop – looking over – stop  
What if I miss something ?

.  
A single star

this lonely point in the sky screaming for perspective.  
dare to look at me

would I forget myself if my eyes were tied up in the dark ?       

forever   
over there  
.

look

.  
.  
just here

/ Stop breathing for a minute / just to see /

No one’s around.  
no arms,  
no legs, 
no voices.

I’d rather prefer not to see just a second

.  
Am I floating  
or just diving into an endless hole ?

Digging holes  
twisting perceptions  
squeezing worlds  
making home under a lenient rug.  
.  

.

Someone told me once the gaze has no limits but itself.
