what is your name?

names names  
naming  
naming  
is identifying  
distinguishing  
placing  
ordering  
is categorising  
you don't need my name to relate

why name me?  
just feel me  
I am beneath, beside, underneath, with and above  
I can hold you  
you can hold me

I am a tree  
forget Linnaeus  
eat me  
touch me feel me
