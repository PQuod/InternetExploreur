So fucking stressed, blacked out, wrapped in  
in  
in what?  
merde stront kak  
so fucking tired of  
plastic  
ISOLATION

this not not poetry  
this is not poetry  
this is not poetry  
this is not poetry this not poetry  
an outcry

cry baby cry

plastic  
artificial  
tear the skin and  
feel the pain of habituation

peel it off

there are flowers,  
lovely buds and leaves on soft stems underneath
