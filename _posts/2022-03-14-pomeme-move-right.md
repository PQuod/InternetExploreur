I've been living a lie  
There's such a difference between us and a million miles  
I would like to move in just a little bit closer  
You could hear the beat of polka coming from the neighbors  
While your feet are stomping  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Look ahead the crowd is jumping

Fools said I, you do not know  
There's no comfort in the truth  
The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls  
No escape from realism  
abre_los_ojos.avi  
Don't tell me you're too blind to see  
A vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping  
The dream of a people their fortress secure  
The whole crowd goes so loud  
Long live our people, united and free  
This is going down in History

A sudden kiss in the morning  
Now that I know what I'm without  
I seek to cure what's deep inside  
I won’t let you do anything that makes me dislike you  
I'm getting closer and I'm putting together the plan  
A full commitment is what I'm thinking of  
You think that's air you're breathing now  
But the metaphor men beg to differ

Look at this internet that I just found  
Tell somebody you go tell somebody  
Inside we both know what's been going on  
Memes were changing the mind of pretenders  
The most versatile substance on the planet  
and they used it to make a boomerang  
I've filled the halls of folklore with things I'd rather we forget  
Only blue checks and memes, remember

All I know is that to me  
The condition of the State insults my intuition  
Why should we be pleasing all the politician heathens?  
Hollow vows, even promises broken  
They don’t have to come and confess we looking for them  
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage  
Just follow my moves and sneak around  
Set your house on perfect fire before you criticize the world  
My world's on fire, how about yours?  
Yeah yeah this is guerilla wooo  
When I say go, be ready to throw  
You bite the fire, the fire bites back  
and the heat just absorbs all the space  
and all the air possible all in your throat  
to the point that if you wanted to start talking  
nothing is coming out
