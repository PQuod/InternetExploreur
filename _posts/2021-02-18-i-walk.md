I walk

I walk  
I know it doesn’t look like it  
and myself I don’t always believe it 	  
but I walk.  
It’s slow, it’s clumsy,  
& there’s pain most of the time.

When I wake up in the morning I ask myself  
« how far can I go today ? »   
When my mood is dark as a stormy sky,  
I roll my eyes and scare myself :  
« will I ever walk normally again ? »

might sound obvious to the wisest  
but for me it’s a bit of a hocus pocus  
‘cause you have no idea how it’s precious  
until you’ve lost it  
until you’re stuck  
with you  
yourself   
and I,  
all day long
bloody-so-long

I don’t run I don’t jump I don’t swim  
I can’t dance I can’t sit I can’t stand still to watch through the star-lit  
night  
I’ve learnt to walk slower than all of you together  
slower than my dad when he’s working undercover  
slower than the oldies who like to take me over   
for once they can beat someone so much younger

I decided that I’d just let it be  
and struggle less and less with good old philosophy  
I’ve even embraced slowness as a lesson for a blessed lesser-life  
 ‘cause I might walk slow  
 but I walk

*I take the power of the word*  
*to the power of the walk*  
*the power of the walk*  
*to the power of the word*

*I take the power of the word*  
*to the power of the walk*  
*the power of the walk*  
*to the power of the word*

*walk your words baby*  
*you get to choose your own pace*

I walk  
I merely need to say it, enough to feel like I walk  
so I do it a lot, over and over  
I test it in each language I know  
je marche, ich gehe, merg, cammino, nothing works as well as  
I walk  
I hush it like a pagan prayer  
silently shout it like it’s my last hour

I dream  
I dream of all the walks that could come live again if I gave them  
once  
or twice  
an existence through sound.  
I dream that  
I’m tiny  
I walk at the top of your head, on the back of your hand,  
on the tip of your toes I nearly fall  
you can’t see me I’m too tiny  
but I’m all around,  
here, there,  
here now, there again,  
woops, sorry, that’s your nose,  
I swear I was heading to your toes  
sometimes I’m unsure where to walk  
I just walk

then I’m huge  
I walk from planet to planet, one planet a step  
I’m so huge no one can notice that I walk  
and why is no more a question  
My pace is of a long-headed giant  
bent forward, thin,  
careful not to tread on a life, two, or maybe a million  
during one of my intergalactic hiccups  
and while I walk  
the sun holds in my hand and the moon is at my ear  
singing songs that I’m not about to forget  
not as long as I walk

*I take the power of the word*  
*to the power of the walk*  
*the power of the walk*  
*to the power of the word*

*I take the power of the word*  
*to the power of the walk*  
*the power of the walk*  
*to the power of the word*

*walk your words baby*  
*you get to choose your own pace*

I’m old  
My very first stick now hangs on the wall  
next to the more recent ones, the modern ones – I swear I love them all,  
vivid memory of an agitated youth  
I go faster than the old ladies now  
« Girls, I have many years of practice! no need to try and beat me »  
I walk faster and faster  
towards my own death  
hoping they won’t shoot me  
like that poor dying deer  
who couldn’t walk anymore

now I run  
I run to you like Kevin Costner to Whitney Houston on that famous tarmac  
or through the blooming fields without watching where I run  
I run like I’ve never stopped running and it’s just for fun  
I wish you could see me mum: I run better than I’ve ever walked  
see how I’ve learnt your lesson, mum, how much I fought?  
look, I’m like them now, I’m invisible  
I run now, I’m invincible.

*I take the power of the word*  
*to the power of the walk*  
*the power of the walk*  
*to the power of the word*

*I take the power of the word*  
*to the power of the walk*  
*the power of the walk*  
*to the power of the word*

*walk your words baby*  
*you get to choose your own pace*
