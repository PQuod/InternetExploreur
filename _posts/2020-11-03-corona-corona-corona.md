wish I could touch you, dance with you  
love you

je veux

l'envoi d'odeur pestilencieux  
me gâche, gâche, bâche, trashe

envie de tout foutre  
foutre  
dehors  
envie que tu me transperces le cul  
envie d'une respiration qui se sent, d'un corps qui s'étend et prend  
je te lèche

de plus en plus je m'enferme  
deviens incapable de contact  
de partage

ma tête est close  
je ne parle plus  
je ne sais plus dire  
on ne me comprend plus  
je ne m'exprime pas

(*When two hands touch, there is a sensuality of the flesh, an exchange of warmth, a feeling of pressure, of presence, a proximity of otherness that brings the other nearly as close as oneself. Perhaps closer. And if the two hands belong to one person, might this not enliven an uncanny sense of the otherness of the self, a literal holding oneself at a distance in the sensation of contact, the greeting of the stranger within?*) Barad on touch.

I get tired of stories, any stories, all stories, including mine

chaque parole m'éloigne de toi

and you and you and you

touch is the space of the gap, not the connexion

(*When two hands touch, how close are they? What is the measure of closeness? Which disciplinary knowledge formations, political parties, religious and cultural traditions, infectious disease authorities, immigration officials, and policy makers do not have a stake in, if not a measured answer to, this question? When touch is at issue, nearly everyone's hair stands on end.*) Barad on touch.

(*A common explanation for the physics of touching is that one thing it does not involve is ... well, touching. That is, there is no actual contact involved. You may think you are touching a coffee mug when you are about to raise it to your mouth, but your hand is not actually touching the mug. Sure, you can feel the smooth surface of the mug's exterior right where your fingers come into contact with it (or seem to), but what you are actually sensing, physicists tell us, is the electromagnetic repulsion between the electrons of the atoms that make up your fingers and those that make up the mug.*) Karen Barad, "On Touching – The Inhuman That Therefore I Am" (v1.1)
